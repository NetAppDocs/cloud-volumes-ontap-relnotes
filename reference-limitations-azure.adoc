The following known limitations are specific to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Microsoft Azure. Be sure to also review link:reference-limitations.html[Limitations for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in all cloud providers].

== Flash Cache limitations

Some VM types include local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Note the following limitations for Flash Cache:

* Compression must be disabled on all volumes to take advantage of the Flash Cache performance improvements up to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.12.0. When you deploy or upgrade to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.12.1, you don't need to disable compression.
+
You can choose no storage efficiency when creating a volume from BlueXP, or you can create a volume and then http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-vsmg/GUID-8508A4CB-DB43-4D0D-97EB-859F58B29054.html[disable data compression by using the CLI^].

* Cache rewarming after a reboot is not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== HA limitations

HA pairs aren't supported in some regions.

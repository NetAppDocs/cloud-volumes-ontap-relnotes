[.lead]
Several Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations are supported in Azure.

== Supported configurations by license

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Azure as a single node system and as a high-availability (HA) pair of nodes for fault tolerance and nondisruptive operations.

Upgrading a single node system to an HA pair is not supported. If you want to switch between a single node system and an HA pair, then you need to deploy a new system and replicate data from the existing system to the new system.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

For supported instances specifications, refer to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview[Microsoft Azure documentation^].

=== Single node systems

You can choose from the following capacity-based or node-based licensing configurations when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a single-node system in Azure. 

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

Notes:

. ^1^ The DS_v2 and Es_v3 machine families are no longer available for selection on the NetApp Console when deploying new instances of Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure. These families will be retained and supported only in older, existing systems. New deployments of Cloud Volumes ONTAP are supported in Azure only from the 9.12.1 release. We recommend that you switch to either Es_v4 or any other series compatible with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.12.1 and later. The DS_v2 and Es_v3 series machines, however, will be available for new deployments made through the API.

. ^2^ This VM type includes local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It is effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-flash-cache.html[Learn more^].
+
The minimum ONTAP version required for configuring Flash Cache on Azure is 9.13.1 GA.

. ^3^ These VM types use an https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-enable-ultra-ssd[Ultra SSD^] for VNVRAM, which provides better write performance.
+
If you choose any of these VM types when you deploy a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you can't change to another VM type that _doesn't_ use an Ultra SSD for VNVRAM. For example, you can't change from E8ds_v4 to E8s_v3, but you can change from E8ds_v4 to E32ds_v4 because both of those VM types use Ultra SSDs. 
Similarly, if you choose to deploy Premium SSD Managed Disks in an environment that fulfils the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-ha-azure.html#ha-single-availability-zone-configuration-with-shared-managed-disks[criteria^] for Premium SSD v2 Managed Disks, the Console automatically provisions Premium SSD v2 Managed Disks. You cannot switch to Premium SSD v1 Managed Disks..
+
Conversely, if you deployed Cloud Volumes ONTAP using any other VM type, you won't be able to change to a VM type that uses an Ultra SSD for VNVRAM. For example, you can't change from E8s_v3 to E8ds_v4.
+
. ^4^ For information about the supported disk types in single node deployments, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/reference-default-configs.html#azure-single-node[Azure (single node)^]. High write speed is supported with all instance types when using a single node system. You can enable high write speed from the Console during deployment or any time after. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-write-speed.html[Learn more about choosing a write speed^]. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using SSDs.
. ^5^ Beginning on August 11, 2025, the Cloud Volumes ONTAP Optimized license is deprecated and will no longer be available for purchase or renewal in the Azure marketplace for pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscriptions. For more information, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/whats-new.html#11-august-2025[End of availability of Optimized licenses^].

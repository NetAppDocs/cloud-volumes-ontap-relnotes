Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.12.1 includes new enhancements.

Additional features and enhancements are also introduced in the latest versions of BlueXP (formerly Cloud Manager). See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/whats-new.html[BlueXP Release Notes^] for details.

== 9.12.1 RC1 (8 December 2022)
Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.12.1 Release Candidate 1 is now available in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This release includes the following new features and enhancements.

=== ONTAP S3 license in GCP

An ONTAP S3 license is now included on new and existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems running version 9.12.1 or later in Google Cloud Platform.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/object-storage-management/index.html[Learn how to configure and manage S3 object storage services in ONTAP^]

=== NVMe-TCP support in Cloud Volumes ONTAP

NVMe-TCP is supported for cloud providers if you are using Cloud Volumes ONTAP version 9.12.1 or newer. BlueXP does not provide any management capabilities for NVMe-TCP.

For more information on configuring NVMe through ONTAP, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-admin/configure-svm-nvme-task.html[Configure a storage VM for NVMe^].

=== Azure HA in a single availability zone with shared managed disks
You can now deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configuration using Microsoft Azure locally redundant storage (LRS) running on top of shared managed disks. Locally redundant storage replicates your data three times within a single data center in the same region.
 
For more information about the HA configuration architecture and components, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-ha-azure.html[High-availability pairs in Azure^]. 
 
When you deploy a new HA pair in Azure in a single availability zone, you will now be using LRS shared managed disks rather than page blobs for storage. There's no change to the Working Environment wizard. You simply need to choose a Single Availability Zone to use this new configuration. For details, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-otc-azure.html[Launching a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in Azure^].

=== Azure HA in multiple availability zones with shared managed disks
You can now deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA configuration using Azure multiple availability zones within a region. The new configuration protects against data center failure and maintains application availability with the use of Azure zone-redundant storage (ZRS) shared managed disks. 

For more information about the HA configuration architecture and components, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-ha-azure.html[High-availability pairs in Azure^]. 

To use this new configuration, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-otc-azure.html[Launching a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in Azure^].

== c4, m4, and r4 instances no longer supported (28 October 2022)

In AWS, the c4, m4, and r4 EC2 instance types are no longer supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. If you have an existing system thatâ€™s running on a c4, m4, or r4 instance type, you must change to an instance type in the c5, m5, or r5 instance family.

Refer to link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/communications/ECMLP2880231.html[NetApp Support^] to learn more about the end of availability and support for these instance types.

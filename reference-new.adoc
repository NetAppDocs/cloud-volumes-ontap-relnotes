Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.17.1 includes new enhancements.

You can now use the Release Candidate 1 of Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.17.1 for deployment and upgrade in Azure and Google Cloud. However, this version is unavailable for deployment and upgrade in AWS.


//Update this section for every major release and every patch. This section can have a patch version as the first major release available for deployment and upgrade. Other patches might top this one. When 9.x.1 version of a 9.x.0 version is available, the patch rls for 9.x.0 stops: MM


== Upgrade notes

Read through these notes to learn more about upgrading to this release.

=== How to upgrade

Upgrades of Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be completed from BlueXP. You should not upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP by using System Manager or the CLI. Doing so can impact system stability.

=== Supported upgrade path
You can upgrade to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.17.1 GA from the 9.16.1 release in Azure and Google Cloud. BlueXP will prompt you to upgrade eligible Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to this release.

[NOTE]
In AWS, you can upgrade to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.17.1 RC only from 9.16.1 P5. Upgrading from earlier patch versions or release versions of 9.16.1 is not supported.


//Update this version for every major release. 9.x.0 v is can be usually upgraded from only the prev 9.x.1 version. But if the 9.x.0 version for a release has not gone, the n-2 for 9.x.1 will not be continued, and in that case only the previous 9.x.1 will be the upgrade path. Connector version removed as per code separation verification from engg: MM

=== Downtime

* The upgrade of a single node system takes the system offline for up to 25 minutes, during which I/O is interrupted.

* Upgrading an HA pair is non-disruptive and I/O is uninterrupted. During this non-disruptive upgrade process, each node is upgraded in tandem to continue serving I/O to clients.

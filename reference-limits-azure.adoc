Cloud Volumes ONTAP has storage configuration limits to provide reliable operations. For best performance, do not configure your system at the maximum values.

== Maximum system capacity by license

The maximum system capacity for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is determined by its license. The maximum system capacity includes disk-based storage plus object storage used for data tiering.

NetApp doesn't support exceeding the system capacity limit. If you reach the licensed capacity limit, BlueXP displays an action required message and no longer allows you to add additional disks.

[cols="25,75",width=65%,options="header"]
|===
| License
| Maximum system capacity (disks + object storage)

| Freemium | 500 GiB
| PAYGO Explore	| 2 TiB (data tiering is not supported with Explore)
| PAYGO Standard | 10 TiB
| PAYGO Premium | 368 TiB
| Node-based license | 2 PiB (requires multiple licenses)
| Capacity-based license | 2 PiB

|===

.For HA, is the license capacity limit per node or for the entire HA pair?

The capacity limit is for the entire HA pair. It is not per node. For example, if you use the Premium license, you can have up to 368 TiB of capacity between both nodes.

== Aggregate limits

Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses Azure storage as disks and groups them into _aggregates_. Aggregates provide storage to volumes.

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter
| Limit

| Maximum number of aggregates | Same as the disk limit
| Maximum aggregate size ^1^ |
384 TiB of raw capacity for single node ^2^
352 TiB of raw capacity for single node with PAYGO
96 TiB of raw capacity for HA pairs with page blob
384 TiB of raw capacity for HA pairs with managed disks
| Disks per aggregate	| 1-12 ^3^
| Maximum number of RAID groups per aggregate	| 1
|===

Notes:

. The aggregate capacity limit is based on the disks that comprise the aggregate. The limit does not include object storage used for data tiering.

. If using node-based licensing, two BYOL licenses are required to reach 384 TiB.

. All disks in an aggregate must be the same size.

== Disk and tiering limits by VM size

Capacity limits are different depending on the VM size that you use and whether you're using a single node system or an HA pair.

The following notes provide details about the numbers that you'll see in the tables below:

* The disk limits are specific to disks that contain user data.
+
The limits do not include the root disk, core disk, and VNVRAM.

* A maximum system capacity is listed when using disks alone and when using disks and cold data tiering to object storage.

* Single node and HA systems which use managed disks have a maximum of 32 TiB per disk. The number of supported disks varies by VM size.

* HA systems which use page blobs have a maximum of 8 TiB per page blob. The number of supported disks varies by VM size.

* The 896 TiB disk-based limit that's listed for single node systems with certain VM sizes is the _tested_ limit.

=== Limits for capacity-based licensing

The following disk limits apply to Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that use a capacity-based licensing package. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-licensing.html[Learn about Cloud Volumes ONTAP licensing options^]

=== Limits for node-based licensing

The following disk limits apply to Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that use node-based licensing, which is the previous generation licensing model that enabled you to license Cloud Volumes ONTAP by node. Node-based licensing is still available for existing customers.

You can purchase multiple node-based licenses for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL single node or HA pair system to allocate more than 368 TiB of capacity, up to the maximum tested and supported system capacity limit of 2 PiB. Be aware that disk limits can prevent you from reaching the capacity limit by using disks alone. You can go beyond the disk limit by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-data-tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-manage-node-licenses.html[Learn how to add additional system licenses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP^]. Though Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports up to the maximum tested and supported system capacity of 2 PiB, crossing the 2 PiB limit results in an unsupported system configuration.

==== Single node

== Storage VM limits

Some configurations enable you to create additional storage VMs (SVMs) for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

These are the tested limits. While it is theoretically possible to configure additional storage VMs, it's not supported.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-managing-svms-azure.html[Learn how to create additional storage VMs^].

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| License type
| Storage VM limit

| *Freemium* a|
24 storage VMs total ^1,2^

| *Capacity-based PAYGO or BYOL* ^3^ a|
24 storage VMs total ^1,2^

| *Node-based BYOL* ^4^ a|
24 storage VMs total ^1,2^

| *Node-based PAYGO* a|
* 1 storage VM for serving data
* 1 storage VM for disaster recovery

|===

. These 24 storage VMs can serve data or be configured for disaster recovery (DR).

. Each storage VM can have up to three LIFs where two are data LIFs and one is an SVM management LIF.

. For capacity-based licensing, there are no extra licensing costs for additional storage VMs, but there is a 4 TiB minimum capacity charge per storage VM. For example, if you create two storage VMs and each has 2 TiB of provisioned capacity, you'll be charged a total of 8 TiB.

. For node-based BYOL, an add-on license is required for each additional _data-serving_ storage VM beyond the first storage VM that comes with Cloud Volumes ONTAP by default. Contact your account team to obtain a storage VM add-on license.
+
Storage VMs that you configure for disaster recovery (DR) don't require an add-on license (they are free of charge), but they do count against the storage VM limit. For example, if you have 12 data-serving storage VMs and 12 storage VMs configured for disaster recovery, then you've reached the limit and can't create any additional storage VMs.

Several Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations are supported in Google Cloud.

== Supported configurations by license

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Google Cloud Platform as a single node system and as a high-availability (HA) pair of nodes for fault tolerance and nondisruptive operations.

Upgrading a single node system to an HA pair isn't supported. If you want to switch between a single node system and an HA pair, then you need to deploy a new system and replicate data from the existing system to the new system.

| Supported disk types 6+| Balanced persistent disks ^4^, Performance (SSD) persistent disks ^4^, and Standard (HDD) persistent disks.

Notes:

. Disk limits can prevent you from reaching the maximum system capacity limit by using disks alone. You can reach the capacity limit by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-data-tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^].
+
link:reference-limits-gcp.html[Learn more about disk limits in Google Cloud].

. Data tiering to Google Cloud Storage isn't supported with PAYGO Explore.

. The custom-4-16384 machine type is no longer supported with new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
If you have an existing system running on this machine type, you can keep using it, but we recommend switching to the n2-standard-4 machine type.

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using Balanced persistent disks and Performance (SSD) persistent disks.

. The BlueXP interface shows an additional supported machine type for Standard and BYOL: n1-highmem-4. However, this machine type isn't meant for production environments. We've made it available for a specific lab environment only.

. For Google Cloud Platform region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

. Starting with Cloud Volumes ONTAP software version 9.13.0, _Flash Cache_, high write speed, and a higher maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 8,896 bytes, are available for the following HA pair deployment instances: 
* n2-standard-16
* n2-standard-32
* n2-standard-48
* n2-standard-64
+ 
You can enable _Flash Cache_, and high write speed when deploying an eligible instance type. To enable the higher maximum transmission unit of 8,896 bytes, you must chose VPC-1, VPC-2, or VPC-3 for the deployment. The higher MTU enables higher network throughput. For more information on launching one of these deployments, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-gcp.html#launching-an-ha-pair-in-google-cloud[Launching an HA pair in Google Cloud].
+ 
NOTE: _Flash cache_, high write mode, and an MTU of 8,896 are feature-dependent and cannot be disabled individually within a configured instance. 

== Supported disk sizes

In Google Cloud, an aggregate can contain up to 6 disks that are all the same type and size. The following disk sizes are supported:

* 100 GB
* 500 GB
* 1 TB
* 2 TB
* 4 TB
* 8 TB
* 16 TB
* 64 TB

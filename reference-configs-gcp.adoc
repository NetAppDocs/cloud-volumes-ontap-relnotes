Several Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations are supported in Google Cloud.

== Supported configurations by license

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Google Cloud Platform as a single node system and as a high-availability (HA) pair of nodes for fault tolerance and nondisruptive operations.

Upgrading a single node system to an HA pair isn't supported. If you want to switch between a single node system and an HA pair, then you need to deploy a new system and replicate data from the existing system to the new system.

Notes:

. Disk limits can prevent you from reaching the maximum system capacity limit by using disks alone. You can reach the capacity limit by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-data-tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^].
+
link:reference-limits-gcp.html[Learn more about disk limits in Google Cloud].

. Data tiering to Google Cloud Storage isn't supported with PAYGO Explore.

. The custom-4-16384 machine type is no longer supported with new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
If you have an existing system running on this machine type, you can keep using it, but we recommend switching to the n2-standard-4 machine type.

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using SSDs.

. The Cloud Manager interface shows an additional supported machine type for Standard and BYOL: n1-highmem-4. However, this machine type isn't meant for production environments. We've made it available for a specific lab environment only.

. For Google Cloud Platform region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

== Supported disk sizes

In Google Cloud, an aggregate can contain up to 6 disks that are all the same type and size. The following disk sizes are supported:

* 100 GB
* 500 GB
* 1 TB
* 2 TB
* 4 TB
* 8 TB
* 16 TB
* 64 TB
